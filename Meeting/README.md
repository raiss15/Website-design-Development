# Meeting Notes Application

## Project Description

This project is a simple Meeting Notes Application developed using vanilla JavaScript and SCSS. It allows users to view, add, and edit meeting notes. Each note contains a title, content, action items, and a creation date. The application provides a list view of all notes fetched from a JSON file and supports interactions such as expanding a note's content, editing notes, and toggling action items' completion status.

## How to Run

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```
   git clone [repository-url]
   ```
2. **Navigate to the project directory:**
   ```
   cd [project-directory]
   ```
3. **Install dependencies (if any):**
   ```
   npm install
   ```
4. **Compile SCSS to CSS:**
   ```
   npm run sass
   ```
5. **Open `index.html` in your browser to view the application.**

No server or database setup is required as the application does not persist data on the backend.
